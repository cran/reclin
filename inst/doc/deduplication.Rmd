```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


```{r,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(reclin)
library(dplyr)
```

Using `reclin` for deduplication will be demonstrated using an example 

Towns with names containing 'rdam' or 'rdm' have been selected. This should 
contain most records concerning the two largest cities in The Netherlands: 
Amsterdam and Rotterdam. 


```{r}
data("town_names")
head(town_names)
```

First, we do a little bit of cleanup of the names. We have a lot of names of the
form 'amsterdam z.o.', 'amsterdam zo', etc. Removing non-alphanumeric characters
will probably help. Also, some of the O's are written as 0's (zeros). 
```{r}
town_names$clean_name <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "", town_names$name)
town_names$clean_name <- gsub("0", "o", town_names$clean_name)
```

We will now compare all records from the dataset to each other. First, we 
generate all possible pairs of records. However, as it is not necessary to 
compare the first record to the second and also the second to the first, we will
only select pairs for which the second index is larger than the first. This is
done by `filter_pairs_for_deduplication`. We compare the names using 
`jaro_winkler` and select records for which the Jaro-Winkler similarity is above
0.88. This value is determined by eye-balling the data. Usually values around
0.9 work.
```{r}
p <- pair_blocking(town_names, town_names) %>% 
  filter_pairs_for_deduplication() %>%
  compare_pairs("clean_name", default_comparator = jaro_winkler()) %>% 
  score_simsum() %>% 
  select_threshold(0.88)
head(p)
```

We have now selected some town names that we consider the same: records 2 and 3 
(record 3 in output above) are the same, and records 3 and 4 (record 6). However,
records 2 and 4 are not classified as belonging to the same record (record 5). 

In our final step we want to assign each record in our original data set `town_names`
into a number of groups, each group containing all records with the same town
names. The function `deduplicate_equivalance` does that. It will use the 'rules'
derived above: `2 and 3 belong to the same group`, 
`3 and 4 belong to the same group`, etc., to assign each record to a group. It 
will, therefore, also assign records 2 and 4 to the same group. For those 
familiar with graph theory: it derives all subgraphs and assigns all nodes in a 
subgraph the same identifier. 

```{r}
res <- deduplicate_equivalence(p)
head(res)
```

As we can see records 2 to 6 are assigned to the same group. We can calculate
the number of groups and compare that to the original number of town names:

```{r}
length(unique(res$duplicate_groups))
length(unique(res$duplicate_groups))/nrow(res)
```
We are only left with `r length(unique(res$duplicate_groups))` town names; a
reduction of approximately 90 percent. For this small number of remaining groups
it is possible to manually derive the correct names, or, if that would be 
available, we could use the most frequent name in each group as the group name. 

Lets assume that we are able to correctly determine the group names. This means
that we assign the most frequent official name to each group:
```{r}
res <- res %>% group_by(duplicate_groups, official_name) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  group_by(duplicate_groups) %>%
  mutate(group_name = first(official_name, order_by = desc(n)))
```

We can then calculate the confusion matrix and calculate the precision and
recall:

```{r}
precision <- res %>% group_by(group_name) %>% 
  summarise(precision = sum(group_name == official_name)/n())

precision_recall <- res %>% group_by(official_name) %>% 
  summarise(recall = sum(group_name == official_name)/n()) %>%
  left_join(precision, by = c("official_name" = "group_name")) %>% 
  mutate(precision = ifelse(is.na(precision), 0, precision))

precision_recall
```

Overall precision and recall

```{r}
summarise(precision_recall, mean(recall), mean(precision))
```
